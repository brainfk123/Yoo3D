# OpenVDB and NanoVDB in Unreal

![Bunny_Cover](Resources/Cover.png)

This repo is a non-official Unreal plugin that can read OpenVDB and NanoVDB files in Unreal.
This plugin was made for Unreal 5 on Windows 64 bit.

## Introduction

This experimental plugin allows importing [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/) and 
[NanoVDB](https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb) files into [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/), 
and basic manipulation of VDB grids in an Unreal environment.

> OpenVDB is an Academy Award-winning open-source C++ library allowing efficient storage and manipulation of 
>sparse volumetric data on three-dimensional grids  
 
Although [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/) is extremely popular in offline rendering, especially in the 
movie industry, it is surprisingly under-appreciated in the realtime industry, mostly for performance reasons.
Thankfully, NVIDIA recently released [NanoVDB](https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb), a lighter and GPU-friendly 
version of OpenVDB.

> NanoVDB employs a compacted, linearized, read-only representation of the VDB tree structure


**We add support for both these libraries in Unreal, giving artists access to a new range of possibilities**. 
Once imported, every VDB grids are converted to NanoVDB for better performance.
 
The **goal** isn't to provide a reference viewer for VDB grids (although we do offer some interesting options) but 
to **foster an experimental environment to play with sparse volumes**. We want this plugin to be **as generic as 
possible** to allow a maximum of customization and tinkering, whether you are a (technical) artist or a programmer.

We provide direct support for (simplistic) realtime rendering with **Unreal materials**, with the option to implement 
your very own raymarching HLSL code in the material editor. If you are a programmer and don't care about Unreal 
materials but still don't want to reinvent the wheel, we also provide a more **traditional and easy-to-modify path 
to render volumes** (ideal to implement the latest rendering and/or denoising paper). We even hacked our way into 
the **pathtracer** to allow for offline rendering experimentations. If you want to sample a volume to create an 
impressive **Niagara system**, that is also possible.

## Installation

### Programmers

Clone the repo in your project `Plugins` folder. You may need to create the `Plugins` folder yourself. 

Unreal will need to be recompiled.



### Regular users

If you are not able to compile Unreal, you can alternatively use the precompiled binaries packages in 
[Releases](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/releases).

Recommended installation steps:
* Download the latest precompiled package from [Releases](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/releases)
* Create an Unreal5 project (or use your current project). Enable `Raytracing` if you plan on using the Pathtracer.
* Close Unreal
* Copy / Extract the plugin folder in your ***project*** `Plugins` folder. You will need to create a `Plugins` 
folder yourself if it doesn't exist already
* Open your Unreal project
* Unreal will ask you to rebuild the new modules. Click yes.
* It should work now ! 

Note that it is also possible to copy the plugin in your ***Unreal*** `Engine/Plugins` folder 
(default install location is `C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.0/Engine/Plugins`.

I also recommend watching [Winbush's great intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEclyxwCWaY&ab_channel=WINBUSH) 
ou Youtube.

### Gallery scene

The plugin now comes with example levels (e.g `LVL_VDB_Gallery`), showing a variety of VDB uses.

You can download the zipped versions with data in [Releases](https://github.com/eidosmontreal/unreal-vdb/releases).

Please note that we also have a [HELPME.md](/HELPME.md) section that can help solve common problems or answer frequently asked questions.

## First steps


Create or get an OpenVDB file, for example 
[bunny.vdb](https://artifacts.aswf.io/io/aswf/openvdb/models/bunny.vdb/1.0.0/bunny.vdb-1.0.0.zip) from the 
[OpenVDB repository](https://www.openvdb.org/download/).

![Import](Resources/openvdb.png)

Drag and drop your VDB file in the content browser, or use the `Import asset` option. An import window will show up, 
where you can select a few options and which grids you want to process (VDB files can contain multiple grids).

![Import](Resources/import_dragndrop.gif)

We decided to import each grid as a single Unreal asset called `VdbVolume` (or sometimes `NanoVdb`) for finer control.
`VdbVolumes` can be either static (`VdbVolumeStatic`) or a dynamic / animated (`VdbVolumeSequence`).  
We only support *FogVolumes* and *LevelSets* for now, and support floating and vector grids. 
Once imported, every grid is stored as a NanoVDB grid, allowing for better performance on the GPU.


`VdbVolumes` can be added to a Level by creating a `VdbMaterialActor` (manually, or by simply drag and dropping 
the asset in the viewport).

![VdbActor](Resources/ls_dragndrop.gif)

* *FogVolumes* `VdbMaterialActors` require a **density** `VdbVolume` to render (we only support density volumes 
for now, as it is the most common case).
* *LevelSets* `VdbMaterialActors` require a narrow-band level set `VdbVolume`.

Double click on `VdbVolume` assets to check their properties.

### Quantization

NanoVDB allows compressing your data to be more lightweight. 
We let users select their own option during import.
This choice can be modified at any time with an asset reimport.

| No quantization (32f) | Fp4 Quantization |
| ----------- | ----------- |

## Sequences / Animations

You can also import a sequence of VDB files, if the plugin can detect a continuous file sequence on your disk.

I recommend checking these 
[free VDB sequences from Embergen](https://jangafx.com/software/embergen/download/free-vdb-animations/), 
available under the CCO license. 

I also recommend compressing your volumes as much as possible during import (cf [Quantization](#Quantization))) to 
speed up streaming times. 

 ![VdbActor](Resources/import_sequence.gif)
 
 Sequences can be previewed in the editor, and played in-game depending on the selected options.

 We also added support for the Sequencer, allowing precise animation control from users.

## Advanced examples

You can now play with Unreal materials to achieve the look you want. `VdbMaterialActors` will only display if they 
use a **`Volume material`**. We provide a few examples that are already compatible with VDB rendering. 

![](Resources/materials.png)

* *LevelSets* (aka *Distance fields*) behave mostly like regular opaque meshes
* *FogVolumes* are transparent objects that we render by **raymarching inside the volumes**. They can be really 
expensive to render, and even more if we sample the directional light.

Note that like any other mesh or texture, **performance may drastically vary** between a small and big volume, 
and is also **screen dependent** (the closer you get to the volume, the more expensive it is to render).

Again, we want to reiterate that it is **not our goal to provide the best rendering** (quality and/or performance) 
possible.
We mostly want to help the community get in the right direction by providing all the relevant setup code, and allow 
adopters to rapidly experiment with their own rendering tests without much effort.

![](Resources/bunny_cloud_unlit.png)

I would be delighted to see what the community comes up with, so please post your shaders and renders online 
(twitter or others) so that we can all enjoy the results, and show the world that volumetric rendering is a 
viable solution now, even in realtime.   

### The Unreal way (aka artist-friendly) 
You can create your own `Materials` based on the provided examples. 
We only support `Volume materials` (which forces you to use the *Additive* blend mode), with `Unlit` and 
`Default Lit` shading models. Any other models have undefined behavior while rendering VDB volumes.

![VolumeMat](Resources/Emissive_rgb_0_1.png)
![VolumeMat](Resources/material_example.png)

* `Albedo` is only used with the `Default Lit` shading mode
* `Emissive` is radiance added at each raymarch step
* `Extinction` acts as a **multiplier** of the volume density (*FogVolumes* only)
* `Ambient Occlusion` is used as the **volume albedo**, i.e the proportion of light being scattered versus absorbed. 

The `Default Lit` shading mode will sample both the ambient light (approximation), and the principal directional light. 
The volumes are self-shadowed by the directional light. Note that sampling the directional light at every step of the 
raymarching process can be really expensive and slow for *FogVolumes*. 

### Niagara

`VdbVolumes` can also be sampled from custom Niagara modules. We provide a NanoVdb `Data Interface`, to allow 
all kinds of operations on the volumes. For complex operations and complete custom access, use the `CustomHLSL` node.

| Vdb Data Interface | Custom Niagara module and emitter |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![VdbActor](Resources/Niagara_DI.png) | ![VdbActor](Resources/Niagara_test.png) | ![VolumeMat](Resources/research_02.png) |


### The hardcoded way

If you don't care about Unreal features (picking, materials, pipeline integration etc.) 
and are tired of spending most of your time recompiling materials and shaders, 
we added a more straightforward option to render `VdbVolumes`. 

We call it the **Principled** mode because the provided hardcoded shader is a unique shader that fits all cases, 
inspired by offline raytracers like 
[Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/volume_principled.html) 
or [Arnold](https://docs.arnoldrenderer.com/display/A5AFMUG/Standard+Volume).
It is accessible through the `VdbPrincipledActor` (and `VdbPrincipledComponent`).

It is using a self-contained and lightweight code-path to render `VdbVolumes` on screen. Iterations are much faster, 
recompiling shaders only takes a couple seconds (compared to minutes with Unreal shaders) and you need not worry about 
classes like `VertexFactory`, `MeshMaterialShader`, `MeshPassProcessor`, `SceneViewExtensions` etc. anymore. You can 
also optionally add a denoiser as a rendering post-process.

This **Principled** mode is also compatible with 
[Unreal's *path tracer*](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/RayTracing/PathTracer/), 
allowing for interesting offline possibilities (graphics research, architecture renders etc.).

### Using the Sequencer and the Movie Render Queue

For offline high-quality rendering, we recommend using the 
[Sequencer and the Movie Render Queue](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/RayTracing/MovieRenderQueue/) 
with the [Path-tracer](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/RayTracing/PathTracer/#path-tracedrendersusingmovierenderqueue) 
to bake a sequence of output images. 
The path-tracer is only compatible with `VdbPrincipledActor` for now.  

[Here is a tutorial](TutorialSequencer.md) showing how to setup the sequencer correctly with the pathtracer. 

## VDB to Volume Texture

For performance-critical uses, it will almost always be more efficient to use 3D textures (aka `volume textures`) 
instead of `VdbVolumes` (unless the volume is really sparse). 3D textures are also hardware-friendly, allowing for "free" 
trilinear interpolation for example. Lastly, `volume textures` are already well integrated in Unreal and 
you can use them anywhere you want.

That is why we provide ways to easily convert your `VdbVolumes` to `Volume textures`. Working directly with `VDBs` is 
much easier and allows for better workflows and pipelines. 

### Converting in editor

You can convert a `VdbVolumeStatic` to an Unreal `volume texture` by simply right clicking on the asset in the 
content browser and selecting `Create Volume Texture`.

![VdbToVolumeTex](Resources/VdbToVolume_editor.png)
 
This is a one-time only conversion, in editor.

### Converting in realtime

We also provide a runtime conversion from (sequences of) vdb volumes to an Unreal `Volume Render Target`, using 
a `VdbToVolumeTextureActor`. 
This allows in-game unpacking of a VDB sparse volume into a dense 3D texture. 

It can help taking advantage of both methods, keeping compact and lean `NanoVDB` buffers for streaming and upload, 
and using volume textures for faster rendering.

![VdbToVolumeTexStreaming](Resources/VdbToVolume_realtime.gif)

You can also pack up to two different `VdbVolumes` into a single render target, depending on the chosen `Method`.

## Known limitations

This is an experimental plugin. Customizing Unreal's renderer proved to be challenging, so be aware that there are 
probably a lot of features that don't work out-of-the box. Most Unreal pipeline features will probably not work 
(debug buffers, global overrides, shadows, transparency orders, issues with hair strands etc.). Some may be easy to fix/implement while 
others aren't possible yet without modifying the renderer's code. 

Please check the [HELPME.md](/HELPME.md) page to maybe find solutions to some frequently asked questions.
 
Regarding VDB features:
* We only support *FogVolumes* and *LevelSets* (aka *Distance Fields*)
* We only support float grids, and vector float grids

We only support Windows 64 bit plateform, and Unreal 5.

Disclaimer: This is my first project using Unreal and OpenVDB/NanoVDB, this plugin started as an educational project 
to learn the engine. Unreal is definitely complex and I'm sure there are other and smarter ways to integrate such
 volumetric features. Feel free to [contact me](https://twitter.com/LambertTibo) if you have some valuable feedback !
